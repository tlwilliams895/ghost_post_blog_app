# ðŸ‘»GhostPost ðŸ‘»
Â The GhostPost Machineâ„¢ is a website where people can anonymously post Boasts or Roasts of whatever they want. Like most services, there is a character limit: 280 characters. We are deliberately not dealing with logins, as that is outside the scope of the project (and beyond our time constraints).Â 

A front end is necessary to make this work, though it doesn't have to be pretty -- invest as much time as you want into it (assuming your application already has the requested features ðŸ¤“).

#### **Your Task**

Create a Django application with the following features.

Back end:

*   <span>One model to represent both boasts and roasts</span>
    *   <span>Boolean to tell whether it's a boast or a roast</span>
    *   <span>CharField to put the content of the post in</span><span></span>
    *   IntegerField for up votes
    *   IntegerField for down votes
    *   DateTimeField for submission time

Front end:Â 

*   Homepage that displays boasts and roasts, sorted by time submitted (hint -->Â [https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/models/querysets/#order-by](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/models/querysets/#order-by))
*   Buttons to filter the content by either boasts or roasts, sorted by time submitted
*   Upvote and downvote buttons for each boast and roast
    *   when clicked, these buttons affect the numbers on the relevant post appropriately
*   Ability to sort content based onÂ vote score (_hint:_ you may need to calculate the vote score)Â 
*   Page to submit a boast or a roast
